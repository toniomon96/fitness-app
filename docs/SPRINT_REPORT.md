---

### What Was Built

#### 1. Exercise Library Expansion (161 → 316 Exercises)

Seven new exercise data files were created under `src/data/exercises/`:

| File | Category | Count | Notable exercises |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cable.ts` | Cable machine | 40 | Cable crossover, lat pulldown, seated row, face pull, tricep pushdown, Pallof press |
| `machine.ts` | Machine / Smith | 30 | Leg press, leg extension, leg curl (lying + seated), hack squat, pec deck, step mill |
| `kettlebell.ts` | Kettlebell | 23 | KB swing, single-arm swing, Turkish get-up, snatch, clean, thruster, renegade row |
| `ez-bar.ts` | EZ bar | 10 | EZ curl, skull crusher, preacher curl, spider curl, good morning |
| `resistance-band.ts` | Band | 19 | Face pull, pull-apart, hip thrust, clamshell, monster walk, external rotation |
| `trx.ts` | TRX / Suspension | 15 | TRX row, push-up, hamstring curl, pike, Y-fly, single-leg squat assist |
| `mobility.ts` | Mobility | 20 | World's greatest stretch, pigeon pose, 90-90, deep squat hold, cat-cow |

All exercises use the full schema: `steps`, `commonMistakes`, `coachingCues`, `proTips`, `progressionPath`, `exerciseVariants`, `difficulty`, `pattern`, `tags`, `popularityScore`.

**Total after deduplication: 316 exercises** (target was ≥ 300). ✅

`src/data/exercises/index.ts` updated to import all seven new modules.

---

#### 2. Exercise Detail Page Redesign (`src/pages/ExerciseDetailPage.tsx`)

The page was fully rewritten to deliver the Sprint B spec:

**New components and features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Difficulty Badge** | 1–5 star visual indicator color-coded: green (beginner) → yellow (intermediate) → red (advanced) |
| **Four-Tab Interface** | How To · Common Mistakes · Variations · Coach Cues — horizontal scrollable tab bar |
| **Equipment Substitute Finder** | Collapsible "Can't do this exercise?" card. Shows up to 3 alternatives via `exerciseVariants`. Clicking navigates to the alternative's detail page |
| **Personal Best** | Two-cell card showing best recorded set weight and estimated 1-rep max from workout history. Only shown when history exists |
| **Related Exercises** | Shows up to 3 exercises sharing the same movement pattern but different equipment. Clicking navigates to them |
| **Movement Pattern Library Button** | Placeholder link to `/library` with `filterPattern` state (Sprint I will consume it to filter the exercise browser) |

**Tabs detail:**
- **How To** — numbered step list using `steps` field (falls back to `instructions`)
- **Common Mistakes** — list of `commonMistakes` with the mistake name and the `why` explanation
- **Variations** — shows `proTips`, progression path (easier/harder with clickable navigation), and `tips`
- **Coach Cues** — displays `coachingCues` as styled quote cards

All existing functionality is preserved: YouTube demo embed, Your Progress chart, AI Progression Suggestion, Ask Omnexus button, Related Learning lessons.

## What Still Needs to Be Done

The following sprints remain from the implementation plan. Listed in execution order:

---

### Sprint I — Exercise Discovery Engine ✅
**Epic 1** · **COMPLETE**

Replaces the flat exercise list with five discovery modes. **Shipped in `ExerciseLibraryPage`**.

**Discovery modes implemented:**

| Tab | Description | Filter |
|---|---|---|
| 🔍 Search | Fuzzy text search with trigram similarity + aliases | `query` |
| 🔄 Pattern | 3×3 grid of 9 movement pattern tiles | `pattern` |
| 💪 Muscle | Horizontal-scroll muscle group pills | `muscle` |
| 🏋️ Equipment | Equipment pills + optional "My Gym" button from training profile | `equipment` |
| ⭐ Level | Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced selector with star indicators | `difficulty` |

**"My Gym" button**: fetches the user's `training_profile` from Supabase on mount (authenticated users only). When the profile contains equipment, a "My Gym" chip appears in the Equipment tab that filters to exercises matching any of the user's equipment types.

**filterPattern deep-link**: `ExerciseDetailPage`'s "Movement Pattern Library Button" navigates to `/library` with `{ state: { filterPattern } }`. The library page reads this state on mount and auto-activates the Pattern tab with the correct pattern pre-selected.

**New files:**
- `src/components/exercise-library/MovementPatternGrid.tsx`
- `src/components/exercise-library/DifficultyFilter.tsx`

**Modified files:**
- `src/pages/ExerciseLibraryPage.tsx` — full redesign

## Priority Order Recommendation

```
Sprint I  → Exercise Discovery ✅ COMPLETE
Sprint C  → Gamification + Learning DB ✅ COMPLETE
Sprint D  → Courses + Quiz
Sprint E  → Remaining Courses + Spaced Repetition
Sprint F  → Social + Leaderboard
Sprint G  → Omni AI Coach
Sprint J  → Celebrations + Share Cards
