## v2.0 — Product Depth

> Goal: Make Omnexus the best AI-powered fitness coaching app in the market.
> Focus: depth of AI, personalization, computer vision, offline resilience, and video content.

### 2.1 — AI Form Coach (Computer Vision)
- **MediaPipe Pose / MoveNet** — real-time pose estimation via device camera during sets
- Joint angle tracking (knee, hip, elbow, spine) compared to ideal rep profiles
- Cue cards rendered at end of each set ("chest didn't touch bar on 3 reps")
- Claude vision fallback — upload a clip for async analysis when on-device model underperforms
- Works fully offline on-device; clips never sent to server without user consent
- In-app video player component for playback with overlaid skeletal mesh

### 2.2 — Full Wearables Integration
- Enable HealthKit (iOS) and Health Connect (Android) — full permissions flow
- Pull heart rate, HRV, sleep score, active calories into daily dashboard
- Recovery score model: HRV trend + sleep quality → recommend rest vs. train
- Auto-populate logged sets with heart rate zone data from wearable
- HealthWidget expanded: 7-day sleep trend, resting HR history

### 2.3 — In-App Video Content
- Encrypted video hosting (Mux or Cloudflare Stream) for premium exercise demos
- Full-length tutorial courses (not just YouTube embeds) for premium subscribers
- Offline video download — cache lessons for gym use with no signal
- Adaptive bitrate streaming based on network quality

### 2.4 — Offline Sync & Conflict Resolution
- Full offline-first architecture — IndexedDB as local source of truth
- Background sync queue (service worker) — flushes to Supabase on reconnect
- Conflict resolution: last-write-wins with optional merge dialog for set data
- Offline indicators in UI; no spinner on network loss — content always visible
- PWA manifest + install prompt for web users

### 2.5 — Advanced AI Personalization
- Longitudinal training adaptation: Claude analyzes 12+ weeks of history to detect plateaus
- Injury risk flag: flags exercises showing consistent RPE spikes or volume drops
- Fatigue periodization: auto-schedule deload weeks based on accumulated fatigue score
- Nutrition AI: analyze logged meals vs. training load → macro target adjustments
- Sleep quality impact analysis on workout performance correlation

## v3.0 — B2B Gym Licensing

> Goal: License Omnexus to small and mid-size gyms ("mom and pop") as a white-label platform.
> Model: Per-seat SaaS subscription + optional white-label branding fee.

### 3.1 — Multi-Tenancy Architecture
- Gym as tenant: every table gets a `gym_id` column with Row Level Security
- Gym admin role: manage members, view aggregate analytics, create gym-specific programs
- Member onboarding flow: join via gym invite code or QR scan
- Supabase: one project per major gym (isolation) OR shared project with tenant partitioning
- Vercel: per-gym deployment with custom subdomain (`crossfitwest.omnexus.app`)

### 3.2 — White-Label & Custom Branding
- Gym uploads logo, sets primary/accent colors in admin dashboard
- App name configurable per tenant (shows gym's name, not "Omnexus")
- Branded email templates (confirmation, weekly digest) via Resend
- Custom domain support for web app (`app.crossfitwest.com`)
- App Store / Play Store: build script generates branded Capacitor app per gym

### 3.3 — Gym Admin Dashboard
- Web-only admin portal (`/admin`) — not in the mobile nav
- Member roster: view all members, subscription status, last active date
- Aggregate analytics: average workout frequency, most popular exercises, drop-off points
- Program management: create gym-specific programs visible only to members
- Challenge management: create gym-wide challenges with custom prizes/badges
- Bulk invite: upload CSV of member emails → Resend invite flow

### 3.4 — B2B Pricing & Billing
- Per-seat licensing: $X/member/month (volume discounts at 50, 100, 250+ seats)
- Annual plans with prepay discount
- Stripe Billing: usage-based seat counting (metered billing on member activations)
- Gym admin self-service: upgrade/downgrade seats, view invoices, cancel
- Free 30-day trial for gyms (no credit card required)
- Revenue share: partner gyms who refer other gyms get 10% MRR credit

### 3.5 — Trainer Tools
- Coach accounts: trainer role sees assigned clients' workouts in real time
- Program assignment: trainer pushes a specific program to a specific member
- Session annotation: trainer leaves comments on logged sets ("great depth, add 5lb next time")
- Client progress reports: auto-generated weekly PDF digest for each client
- Video review: client uploads form clip, trainer responds with annotated video

### 3.6 — Gym Content & Community
- Gym-scoped community feed (not shared with the global feed)
- Gym challenges visible only to members of that gym
- Gym-specific PubMed article curation (trainer pins articles to gym content library)
- Leaderboard scoped to gym members only

## SDLC & Engineering Standards

All development from v1.4 onward follows this branching and release process.

### Branch Model
```
main          ← production; protected; no direct pushes
develop       ← integration branch (optional for longer cycles)
feat/*        ← new features
fix/*         ← bug fixes
chore/*       ← dependencies, config, scripts
docs/*        ← documentation only
hotfix/*      ← urgent production patches (branch from main, PR back to main)
```

### Commit Conventions
Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
```
feat: add MediaPipe pose estimation to form coach
fix: resolve offline sync conflict on duplicate set logs
chore: bump capacitor to v9
docs: update ROADMAP with v3 B2B section
```

### Release Process
1. Feature branch → PR → code review → CI green → merge to `main`
2. All PRs must pass: `tsc --noEmit` + ESLint 0 warnings + 115 unit tests + E2E suite
3. Merge triggers Vercel preview deployment
4. Tag releases: `git tag v1.4.0` → triggers production deploy
5. Hotfixes: branch from `main` → PR → fast-merge with approver sign-off

### P0 Engineering Backlog (Must fix before v1.4 ships)
- [ ] Cron endpoints (`/api/cron-*`) fail-closed when `CRON_SECRET` is absent
- [ ] `.nvmrc` + `engines` in `package.json` — lock Node to 20.x LTS
- [ ] CORS reject (403) on unknown origin — don't just warn
- [ ] Rate limit middleware active in all environments
- [ ] `Content-Security-Policy` on API responses
