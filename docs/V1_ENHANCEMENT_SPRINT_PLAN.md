# Omnexus V1 Enhancement Sprint Plan

This document turns the product audit into an execution plan for the next phase of Omnexus.

The plan is intentionally biased toward refinement, reliability, and loop clarity before major feature expansion.

## Planning Principles

- Protect the core loop first: Program or Quick Session -> Workout -> Progress -> Insight -> Next Workout.
- Prefer narrowing and clarifying existing surfaces over adding new top-level features.
- Ship in vertical slices: UX, frontend, backend, storage, analytics, and test coverage together.
- Every sprint must improve either trust, clarity, retention, or delivery confidence.
- No sprint closes unless the local gate, the CI gate, and manual product QA are all green.

## North Star Outcomes

- Users trust that workouts and progress are saved.
- New users know what to do next within seconds.
- Returning users feel momentum and continuity.
- Release confidence is high enough that polish work does not stall on CI noise.
- AI features feel useful, understandable, and integrated into the product loop.

## Release Themes

### Theme 1: Trust

- Sync transparency
- Guest-to-account continuity
- Fewer hidden failure states

### Theme 2: Clarity

- One dominant daily action
- Fewer overlapping entry points
- Better guided mode consistency

### Theme 3: Retention

- Stronger post-workout reinforcement
- Weekly progress framing
- Better connection between insights and next action

### Theme 4: Delivery Confidence

- Stable E2E signal
- Safer auth and hydration flows
- Better release discipline

Duration: 3-5 days

Goal:
Establish execution guardrails and baseline metrics before making major product changes.

Product scope:

- Confirm the primary V1 loop and deprioritize non-core additions.
- Identify the exact screens that must improve first: Dashboard, Train, Workout Complete, Profile/Auth, Guest conversion.

Engineering scope:

- Confirm release gates and branch protections.
- Audit CI pass/fail noise by category.
- Establish baseline metrics for activation, workout completion, sync failures, and retention proxies.

Deliverables:

- Sprint backlog for Sprints 1-4 approved.
- Baseline funnel and reliability metrics documented.
- Owners assigned per workstream.

Exit criteria:

- Team agrees on the single primary product loop.

- E2E flaky failure count per week

## Sprint Ceremonies

### Planning

- Start with metric review and unresolved regressions.
- Pull only work with clear acceptance criteria.
- Each ticket must declare user impact, owner, and rollout risk.

### Mid-sprint review

- Review whether the sprint is improving trust, clarity, retention, or delivery confidence.
- Cut scope aggressively if verification quality drops.

### Demo

- Demo full user journeys, not isolated components.
- Show what changed in the experience and what metric it should influence.

### Retro

- Classify issues as product, engineering, QA, or process.
- Add one process improvement task to the next sprint at most.

## Definitions

### Definition of Ready

A ticket is ready only if it has:

- Problem statement
- User impact
- Acceptance criteria
- Test plan
- Analytics or success metric
- Explicit decision on guest/auth/premium behavior

### Definition of Done

A ticket is done only if:

- Code is merged behind the correct branch flow
- Local and CI gates are green
- Tests for the changed behavior exist at the right layer
- Manual QA is completed for the affected journey
- Docs or release notes are updated when behavior changed

## Dependencies and Sequencing

- Sprint 1 should complete before major Dashboard or Train changes land.
- Sprint 2 should complete before retention and motivation polish in Sprint 3.
- Sprint 4 should refine AI behaviors after the core loop is clearer.
- Sprint 5 should be mostly validation and targeted polish, not new architecture.

## Recommended Staffing

- Product owner: decides loop priority, acceptance, and launch scope
- Design/UX owner: Dashboard, Train, completion states, empty states, copy
- Frontend owner: page logic, state flows, instrumentation, component UX
- Backend/platform owner: persistence, APIs, auth, migrations, CI, rollout safety
- QA owner: golden-path journey validation and regression gate ownership
